          <p>Posted by <a href="#">Owner</a> <span>&nbsp;&bull;&nbsp;</span> Filed under <a href="#">templates</a>, <a href="#">internet</a></p>
          <p>The objectives of the ICEGOV series resonate with the participative and inclusive ethos and intent of our FLAGSHIP DIGITAL INDIA PROGRAMME, which, under the guidance and leadership at the highest levels in the country, has amplified the focus on e-governance with major thrusts on infrastructure for electronic connectivity, access to e-services in real time, and digital empowerment of citizens.

ICEGOV events feature rich academic, capacity-building and network programme of keynote lectures, plenary discussions, paper tracks (that include tutorials, paper sessions and workshops), thematic sessions, invited sessions, poster exhibitions, and doctoral colloquia, all built from submitted or invited contributions by researchers and experts from around the world.

ICEGOV2017 invites submissions of original work including research, experience or both, not published or considered for publication elsewhere, that contribute to the conference theme “Building Knowledge Societies - From Digital Government to Digital Empowerment”. The submissions can be targeted at one of the several defined tracks.

SMART CITIES, VILLAGES AND REGIONS

A smart city is an urban development vision to integrate multiple  ICT solutions in a secure fashion to manage a city’s assets namely but not limited to local departments information systems, schools, libraries, transportation systems, hospitals, power plants, water supply networks, waste management, law enforcement, and other community services. ICT allows city officials to interact directly with the community and the city infrastructure and to monitor what is happening in the city, how the city is evolving, and how to enable a better quality of life. Smart cities are aimed at facilitating economic growth and improving the quality of life of people by enabling local development and harnessing technology as a means to create smart outcomes for citizens. Alongside development of smart cities, there is need to develop regions and villages to be smart too to reduce rural urban migration. </p>
